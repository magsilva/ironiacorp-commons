/**
 * The RepositoryTransactionFactory builds RepositoryTransactions for the

 * Currently, only SubVersion is supported, but this could be easyly extended
 * for CVS.
 * 
 * The real problem is not how the repository is accessed. This can be handled
 * without problems by the concrete classes, just requiring a filesystem path
 * to keep the workcopy files. However, authenticating the user can be
 * challenging: not all SCMs uses the famous user/password. For example, they
 * could use public/private keys exchanging. Such problem is delegated to the
 * concrete class, of course, but it will depend solely on the UserIF object
 * to get the required information.
