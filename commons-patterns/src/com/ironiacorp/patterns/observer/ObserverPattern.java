/**
 * Intent: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object
 * changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
 * 
 * Motivation: The need to maintain consistency between related objects without making
 * classes tightly coupled. 
 * 
 * Applicability: Use the Observer pattern in any of the following situations:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>When an abstraction has two aspects, one dependent on the other.</li>
 * 	<li>Encapsulating these aspects in separate objects lets you vary and reuse
 * 	them independently.</li>
 * 	<li>When a change to one object requires changing others</li>
 * 	<li>When an object should be able to notify other objects without making
 * assumptions about those objects</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Minimal coupling between the Subject and the Observer
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>Can reuse subjects without reusing their observers and vice versa</li>
 * 		<li>Observers can be added without modifying the subject</li>
 * 		<li>All subject knows is its list of observers</li>
 * 		<li>Subject does not need to know the concrete class of an observer, just that
 * 		each observer implements the update interface.</li>
 * 		<li>Subject and observer can belong to different abstraction layers</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 	<li>Support for event broadcasting
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>Subject sends notification to all subscribed observers</li>
 * 		<li>Observers can be added/removed at any time</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 
 * Liabilities
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Possible cascading of notifications
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>Observers are not necessarily aware of each other and must be careful
 * 		about triggering updates</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * 	<li>Simple update interface requires observers to deduce changed item</li>
 * </ul>
