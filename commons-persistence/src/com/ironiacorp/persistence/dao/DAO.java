/**
 * Data Access Object. It handles the persistence of objects within an
 * application.
 * 
 * An DAO is transaction agnostic. It is highly discouraged (not to say
 * forbidden) to create, commit or rollback transactions with a DAO
 * object. If any transaction handling is done, it must be entirely under
 * control of the DAO, without any further requirement in the application.
 * We recommend that transaction be handled in the application scope, using
 * Spring or other related framework. If you really need a DAO that defines
 * transactional methods, extend one the classes and keep it in your
 * application.
 * 
 * We adopt the following convention in the interface (and implementation
 * classes): whenever we refer to an 'object', it is an unmanaged object
 * (ie., one that has been removed and is no more managed); if we refer to
 * entity, it is a managed object (ie., one that has been persisted or
 * retrieved using the DAO).
 *
 * @param <K> Primary key for the object.
 * @param <E> Object to be persisted.
